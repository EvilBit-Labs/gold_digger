Linting errors (cargo clippy -- -D warnings)\n3. Test failures (cargo nextest run)\n4. Coverage issues (if applicable)\n5. Security issues (cargo audit, cargo deny)\n6. Pre-commit hooks (if applicable)\n\nAfter each fix, re-run `just full-checks` to verify the changes resolved the issues. Only stop when all checks pass successfully."

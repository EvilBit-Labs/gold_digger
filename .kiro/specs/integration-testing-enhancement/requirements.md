# Requirements Document

## Introduction

Gold Digger currently has limited integration testing that focuses primarily on TLS functionality. To ensure robust operation across different MySQL configurations and data scenarios, we need comprehensive integration tests that use real MySQL instances with seeded test data to validate the complete query-to-output pipeline. These tests will use testcontainers to provide isolated, reproducible database environments and verify that Gold Digger correctly handles various data types, query patterns, and edge cases.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want integration tests that use real MySQL containers with seeded data, so that I can verify Gold Digger works correctly with actual database scenarios.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN integration tests run THEN the system SHALL use testcontainers to create isolated MySQL instances
2. WHEN MySQL container starts THEN the system SHALL seed it with comprehensive test data including various MySQL data types
3. WHEN tests execute THEN the system SHALL connect to the containerized MySQL using Gold Digger's actual connection logic
4. WHEN tests complete THEN the system SHALL automatically clean up containers and temporary files
5. WHEN running in CI THEN the system SHALL work without requiring pre-installed MySQL

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want tests that validate all output formats with real data, so that I can ensure CSV, JSON, and TSV outputs are correctly formatted.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing CSV output THEN the system SHALL verify RFC4180 compliance with actual query results
2. WHEN testing JSON output THEN the system SHALL verify {"data": [...]} structure with deterministic key ordering
3. WHEN testing TSV output THEN the system SHALL verify tab-delimited format with proper quoting
4. WHEN testing with NULL values THEN the system SHALL verify correct NULL handling in each format
5. WHEN testing with special characters THEN the system SHALL verify proper escaping and encoding

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want tests that validate MySQL data type handling, so that I can ensure Gold Digger safely converts all MySQL types to string representations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing with VARCHAR/TEXT types THEN the system SHALL preserve string content exactly
2. WHEN testing with INTEGER/BIGINT types THEN the system SHALL convert numbers to string representation
3. WHEN testing with DECIMAL/FLOAT types THEN the system SHALL preserve numeric precision in string format
4. WHEN testing with DATE/DATETIME/TIMESTAMP types THEN the system SHALL format dates consistently
5. WHEN testing with BINARY/BLOB types THEN the system SHALL handle binary data without panicking
6. WHEN testing with NULL values THEN the system SHALL never panic and handle NULLs according to output format
7. WHEN testing with JSON column type THEN the system SHALL preserve JSON structure in string representation

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want tests that validate error handling scenarios, so that I can ensure Gold Digger provides appropriate error messages and exit codes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing with invalid SQL syntax THEN the system SHALL exit with code 4 and provide meaningful error message
2. WHEN testing with non-existent tables THEN the system SHALL exit with code 4 and indicate table not found
3. WHEN testing with connection failures THEN the system SHALL exit with code 3 and indicate connection problem
4. WHEN testing with permission denied scenarios THEN the system SHALL exit with code 3 and indicate authentication failure
5. WHEN testing with file write failures THEN the system SHALL exit with code 5 and indicate I/O problem

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want tests that validate large result set handling, so that I can ensure Gold Digger performs correctly with substantial data volumes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing with 1000+ row result sets THEN the system SHALL complete successfully without memory issues
2. WHEN testing with wide tables (20+ columns) THEN the system SHALL handle all columns correctly
3. WHEN testing with large text fields (1MB+ content) THEN the system SHALL process without truncation
4. WHEN testing memory usage THEN the system SHALL not exceed reasonable memory bounds for result set size
5. WHEN testing with empty result sets THEN the system SHALL handle gracefully according to --allow-empty flag

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want tests that validate CLI flag and environment variable precedence, so that I can ensure configuration resolution works correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing CLI flags vs environment variables THEN CLI flags SHALL take precedence
2. WHEN testing missing required configuration THEN the system SHALL exit with code 2
3. WHEN testing mutually exclusive flags THEN the system SHALL exit with code 2 with clear error message
4. WHEN testing --query vs --query-file THEN the system SHALL reject both being provided simultaneously
5. WHEN testing format detection vs --format override THEN explicit --format SHALL override file extension

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want tests that validate MySQL-specific features, so that I can ensure Gold Digger works correctly with MySQL/MariaDB specific functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing with MySQL functions (NOW(), CONCAT(), etc.) THEN the system SHALL execute and format results correctly
2. WHEN testing with MySQL-specific SQL syntax THEN the system SHALL handle without errors
3. WHEN testing with different MySQL versions THEN the system SHALL work consistently across versions
4. WHEN testing with different character sets (utf8, utf8mb4) THEN the system SHALL preserve character encoding
5. WHEN testing with MySQL time zones THEN the system SHALL handle timezone-aware timestamps correctly

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want performance benchmarks in integration tests, so that I can detect performance regressions and validate optimization improvements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running performance tests THEN the system SHALL measure query execution time
2. WHEN running performance tests THEN the system SHALL measure output generation time
3. WHEN running performance tests THEN the system SHALL measure memory usage during processing
4. WHEN performance degrades significantly THEN tests SHALL fail with performance regression indication
5. WHEN testing different output formats THEN the system SHALL compare relative performance characteristics

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a developer, I want tests that validate security aspects, so that I can ensure Gold Digger handles credentials and connections securely.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing credential handling THEN the system SHALL never log DATABASE_URL contents
2. WHEN testing error scenarios THEN error messages SHALL not expose connection credentials
3. WHEN testing with TLS connections THEN the system SHALL validate certificate handling
4. WHEN testing connection strings THEN the system SHALL handle special characters in passwords safely
5. WHEN testing verbose output THEN credential information SHALL be properly redacted

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a developer, I want cross-platform integration tests, so that I can ensure Gold Digger works consistently across different operating systems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running on Linux THEN all integration tests SHALL pass with identical results
2. WHEN running on macOS THEN all integration tests SHALL pass with identical results
3. WHEN running on Windows THEN all integration tests SHALL pass with identical results
4. WHEN testing file path handling THEN the system SHALL work with platform-specific path separators
5. WHEN testing line endings THEN output formats SHALL be consistent across platforms

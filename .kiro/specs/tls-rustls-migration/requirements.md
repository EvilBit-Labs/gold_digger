# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature migrates Gold Digger's TLS implementation from OpenSSL/native-tls to Rust native TLS (rustls) to reduce cross-platform build complexity, improve CI reliability, and minimize the native dependency footprint while maintaining full TLS functionality and backward compatibility.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer building Gold Digger, I want TLS support without OpenSSL dependencies, so that I can build consistently across platforms without complex native library setup.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN building Gold Digger with TLS support THEN the build SHALL NOT require OpenSSL system libraries
2. WHEN building on Windows THEN the build SHALL NOT require vcpkg OpenSSL installation
3. WHEN building on Linux THEN the build SHALL NOT require system OpenSSL packages
4. WHEN building on macOS THEN the build SHALL NOT require Homebrew OpenSSL or similar native dependencies
5. WHEN examining the dependency tree THEN openssl-sys SHALL NOT appear as a dependency

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a Gold Digger user, I want TLS connections to MySQL/MariaDB to work identically after the migration, so that my existing configurations and workflows remain functional.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN connecting to a TLS-enabled MySQL server THEN the connection SHALL succeed using rustls backend
2. WHEN using programmatic TLS configuration via mysql::SslOpts THEN the configuration SHALL work with rustls
3. WHEN connecting to servers requiring TLS 1.2 or higher THEN the connection SHALL succeed
4. WHEN connecting without TLS THEN the connection SHALL work as before
5. IF a server requires TLS 1.0 or 1.1 THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messaging about unsupported protocol versions

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a CI/CD maintainer, I want simplified build processes across all platforms, so that builds are faster, more reliable, and require less maintenance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running CI builds on Windows THEN the build SHALL NOT require OpenSSL vcpkg setup steps
2. WHEN running CI builds on any platform THEN OpenSSL-related environment variables SHALL NOT be required
3. WHEN CI builds complete THEN the build time SHALL be reduced compared to OpenSSL-based builds
4. WHEN validating dependencies THEN CI SHALL verify no OpenSSL dependencies are present in the final binary
5. WHEN cross-compiling THEN the process SHALL be simpler without OpenSSL cross-compilation requirements

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a Gold Digger maintainer, I want to preserve existing feature flags and configuration patterns, so that users experience minimal disruption during the migration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the `ssl` feature is enabled THEN TLS functionality SHALL be available via rustls
2. WHEN the `vendored` feature is specified THEN the build SHALL handle it gracefully (as no-op or alternative behavior)
3. WHEN existing code uses mysql::SslOpts THEN the programmatic TLS configuration SHALL continue to work
4. WHEN users upgrade Gold Digger THEN existing TLS configurations SHALL remain compatible
5. IF legacy OpenSSL support is needed THEN an optional fallback feature SHALL be available

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a security-conscious user, I want TLS certificate validation to work correctly with modern standards, so that my database connections remain secure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN connecting to servers with valid certificates THEN certificate validation SHALL succeed
2. WHEN connecting to servers with invalid certificates THEN validation SHALL fail with clear error messages
3. WHEN using custom CA certificates THEN rustls SHALL support the configuration
4. WHEN certificate validation fails THEN the error messages SHALL be informative and actionable
5. WHEN using self-signed certificates in development THEN appropriate configuration options SHALL be available

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer creating static binaries, I want self-contained executables without runtime TLS library dependencies, so that deployment is simplified in containerized and airgapped environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN building with static linking THEN the binary SHALL NOT require runtime OpenSSL libraries
2. WHEN deploying to minimal container images THEN TLS functionality SHALL work without additional packages
3. WHEN running in airgapped environments THEN TLS certificate validation SHALL work with embedded root certificates
4. WHEN distributing binaries THEN they SHALL be portable across systems without TLS library version concerns
5. WHEN examining binary dependencies THEN no dynamic OpenSSL library links SHALL be present

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a Gold Digger contributor, I want clear documentation about the TLS migration, so that I understand the changes and can troubleshoot any issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reading project documentation THEN the rustls migration SHALL be clearly documented
2. WHEN troubleshooting TLS issues THEN migration-specific guidance SHALL be available
3. WHEN configuring TLS programmatically THEN examples SHALL show rustls-compatible patterns
4. WHEN legacy OpenSSL support is needed THEN fallback options SHALL be documented
5. WHEN updating from previous versions THEN migration notes SHALL explain any breaking changes

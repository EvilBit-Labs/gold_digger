# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature establishes a comprehensive documentation system for Gold Digger that combines API
documentation (rustdoc) with user-focused guides (mdBook) to serve both developers and end users.
The documentation will be hosted on GitHub Pages and include interactive features like admonitions,
diagrams, link validation, table of contents generation, and internationalization support.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a Gold Digger user, I want comprehensive documentation that explains how to use
the tool effectively, so that I can quickly understand installation, configuration, and usage
patterns without reading source code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the documentation site THEN they SHALL see a clear landing page with
   navigation to user guides, API documentation, and examples
2. WHEN a user needs installation instructions THEN they SHALL find step-by-step guides for
   different platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux)
3. WHEN a user wants to understand configuration options THEN they SHALL find detailed explanations
   of CLI flags, environment variables, and their precedence
4. WHEN a user needs usage examples THEN they SHALL find practical examples for common use cases
   (CSV export, JSON output, database connections)
5. WHEN a user encounters errors THEN they SHALL find troubleshooting guides with common issues and
   solutions

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer contributing to Gold Digger, I want integrated API documentation
alongside user guides, so that I can understand both the public interface and internal architecture.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer visits the documentation THEN they SHALL find rustdoc-generated API
   documentation integrated with the user guides
2. WHEN a developer needs to understand module structure THEN they SHALL see documented public APIs
   with examples and cross-references
3. WHEN a developer wants to contribute THEN they SHALL find development setup guides and coding
   standards
4. WHEN a developer needs architecture information THEN they SHALL find design documents explaining
   core concepts and constraints

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a documentation maintainer, I want automated validation and enhanced formatting
features, so that I can ensure documentation quality and provide rich content without manual
overhead.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN documentation is built THEN all internal and external links SHALL be validated automatically
2. WHEN documentation includes diagrams THEN Mermaid diagrams SHALL render correctly in the output
3. WHEN documentation needs emphasis THEN admonitions (notes, warnings, tips) SHALL be available and
   properly styled
4. WHEN documentation pages are long THEN table of contents SHALL be automatically generated for
   navigation
5. WHEN documentation needs internationalization THEN i18n helpers SHALL be available for future
   translation support

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a project maintainer, I want the documentation to be automatically deployed to
GitHub Pages, so that users always have access to up-to-date documentation without manual publishing
steps.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is pushed to the main branch THEN documentation SHALL be automatically built and
   deployed to GitHub Pages
2. WHEN rustdoc comments are updated THEN API documentation SHALL be regenerated and included in the
   deployment
3. WHEN mdBook content is modified THEN user guides SHALL be rebuilt and deployed
4. WHEN deployment fails THEN the build process SHALL provide clear error messages and fail the CI
   pipeline
5. WHEN users visit the GitHub Pages URL THEN they SHALL see the latest version of the documentation

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a Gold Digger user, I want the documentation to reflect the current version and
feature set, so that I can rely on accurate information that matches my installed version.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN documentation is generated THEN it SHALL include version information matching the current
   Cargo.toml version
2. WHEN features are documented THEN feature flags SHALL be clearly indicated (e.g., "requires ssl
   feature")
3. WHEN CLI options are documented THEN they SHALL match the current clap configuration
4. WHEN examples are provided THEN they SHALL work with the current codebase and be testable
5. WHEN breaking changes occur THEN migration guides SHALL be provided in the documentation

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a security-conscious user, I want the documentation to clearly explain security
considerations and best practices, so that I can use Gold Digger safely in production environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users read about database connections THEN they SHALL find security warnings about
   credential handling
2. WHEN users configure TLS/SSL THEN they SHALL find clear guidance on certificate validation and
   secure connection options
3. WHEN users handle sensitive data THEN they SHALL find best practices for output file permissions
   and credential redaction
4. WHEN users deploy in production THEN they SHALL find security checklists and hardening
   recommendations
5. WHEN security vulnerabilities are discovered THEN they SHALL be documented with mitigation
   strategies

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a documentation contributor, I want markdown formatting to be consistent and
compatible with both mdBook and the existing project standards, so that documentation maintains
quality and integrates seamlessly with the build process.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN documentation markdown is written THEN it SHALL be compatible with mdBook rendering
   requirements
2. WHEN mdformat is run via justfile or pre-commit THEN it SHALL NOT break mdBook-specific syntax or
   formatting
3. WHEN documentation is built THEN markdown formatting SHALL pass existing project linting
   standards
4. WHEN contributors write documentation THEN they SHALL be able to use existing formatting tools
   without conflicts
5. WHEN mdBook plugins require specific markdown syntax THEN the mdformat configuration SHALL
   preserve that syntax

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer working on Gold Digger, I want convenient justfile recipes for
documentation tasks, so that I can easily build, serve, and maintain documentation locally without
memorizing complex commands.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer wants to build documentation THEN they SHALL run `just docs-build` to generate
   both mdBook and rustdoc output
2. WHEN a developer wants to serve documentation locally THEN they SHALL run `just docs-serve` to
   start a local development server
3. WHEN a developer wants to clean documentation artifacts THEN they SHALL run `just docs-clean` to
   remove generated files
4. WHEN a developer wants to install documentation dependencies THEN they SHALL run
   `just docs-install` to set up mdBook and plugins
5. WHEN a developer wants to validate documentation THEN they SHALL run `just docs-check` to run
   link checking and formatting validation

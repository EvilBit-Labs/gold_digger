# Design Document

## Overview

This design implements a comprehensive CI/CD pipeline enhancement for the Gold Digger project that meets EvilBit Labs standards. The current CI infrastructure already has a solid foundation with cross-platform testing, security scanning, and release automation, but requires optimization and standardization to fully comply with organizational requirements.

The design consolidates and enhances existing workflows (`ci.yml`, `codeql.yml`, `security.yml`, `release.yml`) to create a unified, secure, and efficient pipeline that leverages the project's existing justfile commands and maintains compatibility with the current development workflow.

## Architecture

### Current State Analysis

The project already has:

- ✅ Cross-platform CI testing (Ubuntu 22.04, macOS 13, Windows 2022)
- ✅ Pre-commit hook validation
- ✅ Comprehensive security scanning (CodeQL, Syft, Grype, cargo-audit, cargo-deny)
- ✅ Coverage reporting with Codecov integration
- ✅ SLSA Level 3 provenance and Cosign keyless signing in releases
- ✅ Justfile integration for consistent command execution

### Enhancement Areas

The design focuses on:

1. **Workflow Consolidation**: Streamline separate workflows into cohesive pipeline
2. **Quality Gate Enforcement**: Ensure zero-tolerance policies are properly enforced
3. **Security Integration**: Enhance existing security scanning with better reporting
4. **Performance Optimization**: Improve CI execution time and resource usage
5. **Standards Compliance**: Align with EBL-STD-Pipeline requirements

## Components and Interfaces

### 1. Enhanced CI Workflow (ci.yml)

**Purpose**: Main CI pipeline for pull requests and pushes to main branch

**Key Enhancements**:

- Consolidate quality checks into single workflow
- Optimize caching strategies for faster execution
- Implement proper failure handling with actionable error messages
- Integrate security scanning results into main CI flow

**Interface**:

```yaml
# Triggers
on:
  push: {branches: [main]}
  pull_request: {branches: [main]}
  workflow_dispatch: {}

# Jobs
jobs:
  pre-commit:   # Pre-commit hook validation
  test-matrix:   # Cross-platform testing
  quality-gates:   # Format/lint/security checks
  coverage:   # Coverage reporting (Ubuntu only)
```

### 2. Rust-Native Release Workflow

**Purpose**: Secure, efficient release automation using Rust-native tooling

**Key Components**:

- **taiki-e/upload-rust-binary-action@v1**: Native Rust binary packaging with automatic platform detection
- **sigstore/cosign-installer@v3.6.0**: Keyless signing with OIDC authentication
- **syft**: SBOM generation in CycloneDX format
- **GitHub OIDC**: Secure authentication without personal access tokens

**Workflow Architecture**:

```yaml
# Release workflow structure
jobs:
  resolve-tag:      # Tag resolution and validation
  create-release:   # GitHub release creation
  build-and-package: # Cross-platform builds with Rust-native packaging
  sbom-and-sign:    # SBOM generation and Cosign signing
```

**Key Benefits**:

- **Simplified Complexity**: Removed SLSA framework complexity in favor of proven, reliable tools
- **Rust-Native**: Uses tooling specifically designed for Rust projects
- **Security-First**: Maintains all security requirements (signing, SBOM, OIDC)
- **Maintainable**: Cleaner, more understandable workflow structure

### 3. Consolidated Security Workflow

**Purpose**: Comprehensive security scanning with proper SARIF integration

**Key Enhancements**:

- Merge CodeQL and security scanning into unified workflow
- Implement proper failure thresholds for vulnerability scanning
- Add security artifact management
- Integrate with GitHub Security tab

**Interface**:

```yaml
# Security scanning components
  - CodeQL Analysis (Rust)
  - Clippy SARIF generation
  - SBOM generation (CycloneDX format)
  - Vulnerability scanning (Grype with fail-on critical/high)
  - Dependency auditing (cargo-audit, cargo-deny)
```

### 3. Enhanced Release Pipeline

**Purpose**: Secure, compliant release automation with full attestation

**Current State**: Already implements SLSA Level 3 with Cosign keyless signing

**Key Enhancements**:

- Optimize build matrix execution
- Improve SBOM generation per artifact
- Add checksum validation

- `just lint` - Clippy with `-D warnings` (zero tolerance)
- `just test-nextest` - Test execution with nextest
- `just coverage-llvm` - Coverage generation for CI
- `just ci-check` - Combined quality gates

      tool: cargo-audit
      fail_on_advisory: true
```

## Error Handling

### 1. Quality Gate Failures

**Format Violations**:

# Current: cargo fmt --check (via just fmt-check)
# Enhancement: Provide specific file and line information
Error: Code formatting violations detected
Files: src/main.rs (lines 45-50), src/lib.rs (line 123)
Action: Run 'just fmt' to fix automatically
```

**Lint Warnings**:

```bash
# Current: cargo clippy -- -D warnings (via just lint)
# Enhancement: Categorize warnings and provide fix suggestions
Error: Clippy warnings detected (zero tolerance policy)
Warnings: 3 performance, 1 correctness
Action: Run 'just fix' for automatic fixes or address manually
```

### 2. Security Scan Failures

**Vulnerability Detection**:

```bash
# Current: grype with fail-on critical/high
# Enhancement: Provide remediation guidance
Error: High/Critical vulnerabilities detected
Affected: openssl-sys 0.9.87 (CVE-2023-XXXX)
Remediation: Update to openssl-sys >= 0.9.90
```

**Dependency Audit Failures**:

```bash
# Current: cargo-audit with advisory database
# Enhancement: Link to security advisories and update paths
Error: Security advisory detected
Advisory: RUSTSEC-2023-XXXX affecting serde < 1.0.190
Action: Update Cargo.toml dependencies
```

### 3. Platform-Specific Failures

**Windows Build Issues**:

```bash
# Current: OpenSSL setup for Windows
# Enhancement: Provide platform-specific troubleshooting
Error: Windows build failed - OpenSSL configuration
Cause: vcpkg OpenSSL installation failed
Action: Check Windows runner OpenSSL setup in CI workflow
```

**Cross-Platform Test Failures**:

```bash
# Current: Matrix strategy with fail-fast: false
# Enhancement: Isolate platform-specific vs universal issues
Error: Tests failed on macOS 13
Status: Ubuntu ✅, Windows ✅, macOS ❌

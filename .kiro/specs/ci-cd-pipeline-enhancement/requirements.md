# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements comprehensive CI/CD pipeline improvements for the Gold Digger project to meet EvilBit Labs pipeline standards. The current CI workflows lack cross-platform testing, comprehensive quality gates, security scanning, and proper coverage reporting. This enhancement will replace existing basic workflows with a complete, secure, and standards-compliant CI/CD pipeline.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a project maintainer, I want cross-platform CI testing so that I can ensure Gold Digger works reliably on all supported operating systems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is pushed to main branch THEN the CI pipeline SHALL execute tests on Ubuntu 22.04, macOS 13, and Windows 2022
2. WHEN a pull request is created THEN the CI pipeline SHALL run the complete test matrix across all three platforms
3. WHEN any platform-specific test fails THEN the CI pipeline SHALL fail and block the merge
4. WHEN all platform tests pass THEN the CI pipeline SHALL report success for the cross-platform testing job

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want automated code quality enforcement so that code standards are consistently maintained without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is submitted THEN the CI pipeline SHALL validate pre-commit hooks using pre-commit/action@v3.0.0
2. WHEN code formatting violations exist THEN the CI pipeline SHALL fail with `just fmt-check` and block the merge
3. WHEN clippy warnings are present THEN the CI pipeline SHALL fail with `just lint` using zero-tolerance policy
4. WHEN code quality checks pass THEN the CI pipeline SHALL proceed to testing phases
5. IF quality gates fail THEN the pipeline SHALL NOT use continue-on-error and SHALL block progression

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a security-conscious maintainer, I want comprehensive security scanning so that vulnerabilities and supply chain risks are automatically detected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is analyzed THEN the CI pipeline SHALL run CodeQL security analysis for Rust
2. WHEN dependencies are processed THEN the CI pipeline SHALL generate SBOM using syft
3. WHEN vulnerabilities are scanned THEN the CI pipeline SHALL use grype to identify security issues
4. WHEN security issues are found THEN the CI pipeline SHALL report them as failing checks
5. WHEN SBOM is generated THEN it SHALL be uploaded as a CI artifact for transparency

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a project maintainer, I want comprehensive test execution and coverage reporting so that I can track code quality metrics and ensure thorough testing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests are executed THEN the CI pipeline SHALL use `just test-nextest` for test execution
2. WHEN tests run on Ubuntu THEN the CI pipeline SHALL generate coverage reports
3. WHEN coverage is generated THEN it SHALL be uploaded to Codecov with proper token authentication
4. WHEN test failures occur THEN the CI pipeline SHALL block the merge and report detailed failure information
5. WHEN coverage reports are available THEN they SHALL be visible in pull request comments

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a release manager, I want secure release automation so that all release artifacts are properly signed, attested, and include complete security metadata.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a version tag is pushed THEN the release pipeline SHALL build artifacts for Ubuntu 22.04, macOS 13, and Windows 2022
2. WHEN release artifacts are created THEN they SHALL be signed using Cosign keyless OIDC authentication
3. WHEN releases are published THEN they SHALL include SLSA Level 3 provenance attestation
4. WHEN artifacts are generated THEN they SHALL include comprehensive SBOMs for all components
5. WHEN checksums are created THEN they SHALL use SHA256 and be included with release artifacts
6. IF personal access tokens are used THEN they SHALL be replaced with GitHub OIDC authentication

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want consistent CI integration with project tooling so that all CI operations use the same commands available locally.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN CI jobs execute THEN they SHALL use justfile commands where available (just fmt-check, just lint, just test-nextest)
2. WHEN development setup is needed THEN CI SHALL use `just setup` for consistent environment preparation
3. WHEN CI commands are executed THEN they SHALL produce the same results as local development execution
4. WHEN justfile commands are unavailable THEN CI SHALL fall back to direct cargo commands with equivalent parameters

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a project maintainer, I want deprecated workflow cleanup so that the CI infrastructure is streamlined and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN new CI workflows are implemented THEN existing rust.yml SHALL be removed
2. WHEN security integration is complete THEN rust-clippy.yml SHALL be removed
3. WHEN release workflow is enhanced THEN old release.yml SHALL be updated or replaced
4. WHEN cleanup is complete THEN only necessary workflow files SHALL remain in .github/workflows
5. WHEN documentation is updated THEN README SHALL reflect new CI capabilities and requirements

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper error handling and exit codes so that CI failures are clearly communicated and actionable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN CI jobs fail THEN they SHALL use proper exit codes instead of generic -1
2. WHEN security scans fail THEN they SHALL provide actionable error messages
3. WHEN quality gates fail THEN they SHALL specify exactly which standards were violated
4. WHEN platform-specific failures occur THEN they SHALL be clearly attributed to the specific platform
5. WHEN CI completes successfully THEN all jobs SHALL report clear success status

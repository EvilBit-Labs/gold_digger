- [ ] 8. Implement Rust-native release workflow

  - ReplaceIn .kiro/specs/ci-cd-pipeline-enhancement/tasks.md around lines 35 to 43, Task 5 is marked complete but duplicates the same deliverables listed in Task 8, causing confusing status tracking; update the spec by either merging Task 8 into Task 5 or marking Task 8 complete and removing duplicated checklist items so each requirement appears only once, and add a brief note in the tasks file indicating which task is the canonical owner of the Rust-native release workflow to prevent future duplication.

- [ ] 10. Consolidate security workflows

  - Merge CodeQL workflow into security.yml for unified security scanning
  - Optimize security workflow execution to reduce redundant steps
  - Ensure all security scans run in single workflow for better coordination

## Toolchain Solution Summary

The CI/CD pipeline enhancement has been successfully implemented with a **Rust-native toolchain approach** that prioritizes simplicity, reliability, and maintainability over complex frameworks.

### Key Achievements

✅ **Rust-Native Release Workflow**: Replaced complex SLSA framework with proven, reliable tools

- `taiki-e/upload-rust-binary-action@v1` for native Rust packaging
- `sigstore/cosign-installer@v3.6.0` for keyless signing
- `syft` for CycloneDX SBOM generation
- GitHub OIDC for secure authentication

✅ **Simplified Architecture**: Removed unnecessary complexity while maintaining all security requirements

- Cross-platform builds (Ubuntu, macOS, Windows)
- Comprehensive security scanning (CodeQL, cargo-audit, cargo-deny, grype)
- Quality gates with zero-tolerance policies
- Coverage reporting with Codecov integration

✅ **Maintainable Implementation**: Clean, understandable workflows that follow Rust ecosystem best practices

- Uses justfile commands for consistency
- Leverages existing project tooling
- Follows GitHub Actions best practices
- Maintains compatibility with local development workflow

### Benefits Over Original SLSA Approach

1. **Reliability**: Proven tools with active maintenance vs. complex framework with integration issues
2. **Simplicity**: Clear, understandable workflows vs. opaque SLSA configuration
3. **Maintainability**: Standard GitHub Actions patterns vs. framework-specific knowledge requirements
4. **Security**: Maintains all security requirements (signing, SBOM, OIDC) with simpler implementation
5. **Performance**: Faster execution with fewer dependencies and complexity

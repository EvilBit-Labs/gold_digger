# Implementation Plan

## Core CI/CD Pipeline Implementation

- [ ] 1. Implement comprehensive security workflow consolidation

  - Integrate CodeQL analysis directly into security.yml workflow (init, autobuild, analyze sequence)
  - Remove standalone `.github/workflows/codeql.yml` to eliminate duplicate CodeQL runs
  - Ensure security.yml contains complete security scanning pipeline with proper triggers
  - Verify all security scans run in single consolidated workflow for better coordination
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3_

- [ ] 2. Enhance SBOM generation with cargo-dist integration

  - Modify security.yml to use cargo-auditable and cargo-cyclonedx via cargo-dist for SBOM generation
  - Replace current syft-based SBOM generation with Rust-native tooling
  - Ensure CycloneDX format SBOMs are generated for all components as specified in requirements
  - Integrate SBOM generation with existing release workflow for consistency
  - _Requirements: 3.2, 5.3, 5.4_

- [ ] 3. Implement automated changelog generation with git-cliff

  - Add git-cliff integration to release workflow for conventional commit-based changelog generation
  - Configure git-cliff to parse commit types, scopes, and breaking changes
  - Ensure changelog maintains chronological order and proper versioning
  - Integrate changelog automation with cargo-dist workflow
  - _Requirements: 9.1, 9.2, 9.3, 9.4, 9.5_

- [ ] 4. Add missing justfile recipes for CI parity

  - Implement `just setup` recipe for consistent development environment preparation
  - Add fallback logic in CI workflows when justfile commands are unavailable
  - Ensure all CI operations have corresponding justfile recipes for local reproduction
  - Verify CI commands produce same results as local development execution
  - _Requirements: 6.1, 6.2, 6.3, 6.4_

- [ ] 5. Implement proper exit codes and error taxonomy

  - Replace generic exit(-1) with proper error codes in CI workflows
  - Implement structured error taxonomy for different failure types
  - Add platform-specific failure attribution in error messages
  - Ensure security scan failures provide actionable error messages with specific remediation steps
  - _Requirements: 8.1, 8.2, 8.3, 8.4, 8.5_

## Release Automation Enhancement

- [ ] 6. Enhance release workflow with Cosign keyless OIDC signing

  - Integrate Cosign keyless OIDC authentication for artifact signing
  - Ensure GitHub OIDC authentication is used instead of personal access tokens
  - Verify SHA256 checksums are generated and included with all release artifacts
  - Implement Rust-native binary packaging with taiki-e/upload-rust-binary-action
  - _Requirements: 5.2, 5.5, 5.6, 5.7_

- [ ] 7. Optimize cargo-dist configuration for cross-platform distribution

  - Review and optimize cargo-dist.toml for all target platforms (Ubuntu 22.04, macOS 13, Windows 2022)
  - Ensure consistent build features across release workflow and cargo-dist
  - Verify installer generation (shell, powershell, homebrew, MSI) works correctly
  - Test cross-platform artifact generation and signing integration
  - _Requirements: 5.1, 5.2, 5.4_

## Documentation and Cleanup

- [ ] 8. Update documentation to reflect new CI capabilities

  - Update README.md to document new CI/CD pipeline features and requirements
  - Add documentation for local CI reproduction using justfile recipes
  - Document security scanning integration and SBOM generation process
  - Create migration guide for developers adapting to new pipeline standards
  - _Requirements: 7.5_

- [ ] 9. Validate and test complete CI/CD pipeline integration

  - Test end-to-end pipeline from code push to release artifact generation
  - Verify cross-platform testing matrix works correctly on all target platforms
  - Test security scanning integration and failure scenarios
  - Validate coverage reporting and Codecov integration functionality
  - Test local CI reproduction using act and justfile recipes
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, 4.5_

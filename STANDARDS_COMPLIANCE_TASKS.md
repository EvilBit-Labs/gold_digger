# Gold Digger - EvilBit Labs Standards Compliance Tasks

**Generated:** 2025-08-16
**Project:** Gold Digger v0.2.5
**Target:** Full compliance with EvilBit Labs Development Standards
**Priority:** High - Required for v1.0 milestone

---

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the tasks required to bring the Gold Digger project into full compliance with EvilBit Labs development standards. The project currently has some infrastructure in place but lacks critical components for CI/CD pipeline compliance, security controls, and modern release automation.

**Current Status:** üî¥ Non-compliant
**Estimated Effort:** 2-3 weeks for full compliance
**Critical Blockers:** 11 high-priority items

---

## üö® Critical Infrastructure Issues (High Priority)

### CI/CD Pipeline Standard Compliance

- [ ] **Branch Protection Issue**: Change default branch from `master` to `main` to align with EBL-STD-Pipeline

  - **Action:** Update GitHub repository default branch setting
  - **Files:** Update `.github/workflows/*.yml` references from `master` to `main`
  - **Impact:** Required for Release Please and modern CI/CD workflows

- [ ] **Inadequate CI Workflows**: Current `rust.yml` and `rust-clippy.yml` don't meet pipeline standards

  - **Current:** Basic build on Ubuntu only, no cross-platform testing
  - **Required:** Cross-platform matrix (macOS, Windows, Linux), comprehensive quality gates
  - **Action:** Replace with EBL-STD-Pipeline compliant workflow

- [ ] **Missing Release Please**: No automated versioning or changelog generation

  - **Action:** Implement Release Please workflow for conventional commits
  - **Files:** Create `.github/workflows/release-please.yml`
  - **Impact:** Required for semantic versioning and automated releases

- [ ] **Non-compliant Release Workflow**: Current release.yml lacks security controls

  - **Missing:** SBOM generation, vulnerability scanning, SLSA provenance, Cosign signing
  - **Action:** Completely rewrite to meet EBL-STD-Pipeline requirements

### Security and Supply Chain (Critical)

- [ ] **No FOSSA License Scanning**: Critical gap in license compliance

  - **Action:** Configure FOSSA GitHub App integration with PR enforcement
  - **Files:** Update CI workflow to include license scanning
  - **Impact:** Blocks PRs with non-compliant licenses

- [ ] **Missing Security Controls**: No CodeQL, SBOM, or vulnerability scanning

  - **Required:** GitHub CodeQL, Syft SBOM generation, Grype vulnerability scanning
  - **Action:** Add security workflow jobs to CI pipeline

- [ ] **No Supply Chain Security**: Missing signing and provenance

  - **Required:** Cosign keyless OIDC signing, SLSA Level 3 provenance
  - **Action:** Implement in release workflow using slsa-github-generator

  ```

- [ ] **cargo-dist.toml**: No standardized release artifact generation

  ```toml
  [cargo-dist]
  targets = [
    "x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu",
    "x86_64-apple-darwin",
    "aarch64-apple-darwin",
    "x86_64-pc-windows-msvc",

## üîÑ CI/CD Workflow Replacements (High Priority)

### 1. Replace rust.yml with ci.yml

**Current Issues:**

- Single platform testing (Ubuntu only)
- No coverage reporting
- No security scanning
- Missing quality gates

**Required Implementation:**

```yaml
name: CI
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  pre-commit:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: pre-commit/action@v3.0.0

  test:
    strategy:
      matrix:
        os: [ubuntu-latest, windows-latest, macos-latest]
    runs-on: ${{ matrix.os }}
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Run tests
        run: |
          just setup
          just test-nextest
      - name: Upload coverage
        uses: codecov/codecov-action@v4

  lint:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Lint
        run: |
          just fmt-check
          just lint

  security:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: CodeQL Analysis
        uses: github/codeql-action/init@v3
        with:
          languages: rust
      - uses: github/codeql-action/autobuild@v3
      - uses: github/codeql-action/analyze@v3
      - name: SBOM Generation
        run: syft . -o spdx-json=sbom.json
      - name: Vulnerability Scan
        run: grype sbom.json
```

### 2. Create release-please.yml

**New File Required:**

```yaml
name: Release Please
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  release-please:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      contents: write
      pull-requests: write
    steps:
      - uses: google-github-actions/release-please-action@v4
        with:
          release-type: rust
          package-name: gold_digger
```

### 3. Complete release.yml Rewrite

- [ ] **Signature Verification Guide**: Cosign verification commands
- [ ] **SBOM Inspection Procedures**: How to examine software bill of materials
- [ ] **Airgap Installation Guide**: Complete offline installation process

---

## üìä Testing and Quality Standards (Medium Priority)

### Enhanced Testing Framework

- [ ] **cargo-nextest Integration**: Already in justfile, ensure CI uses it
- [ ] **Cross-platform Testing**: Extend CI to test on all three platforms
- [ ] **Integration Testing**: Add testcontainers for real database testing
- [ ] **Snapshot Testing**: Add insta for output format validation
- [ ] **Benchmark Testing**: Add criterion for performance regression detection

### Coverage and Quality Metrics

- [ ] **Codecov Integration**: Set up coverage reporting and tracking
- [ ] **Coverage Targets**: Establish minimum coverage thresholds
- [ ] **Quality Gates**: Define acceptable coverage decrease limits

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Code Quality Issues (Medium Priority)

### Critical Code Fixes (From WARP.md)

- [ ] **Pattern Matching Bug**: Fix `Some(&_)` should be `Some(_)` in main.rs:59

  - **Location:** `src/main.rs` extension dispatch logic
  - **Impact:** Affects TSV output format selection

- [ ] **Type Conversion Panics**: Fix NULL/non-string value handling

  - **Location:** `src/lib.rs` `rows_to_strings()` function
  - **Current:** Uses `mysql::from_value::<String>()` which panics on NULL
  - **Solution:** Implement safe type conversion with proper NULL handling

- [ ] **Non-deterministic JSON**: Fix HashMap usage for deterministic output

  - **Location:** `src/json.rs`
  - **Current:** Uses HashMap with non-deterministic key ordering
  - **Solution:** Use IndexMap or BTreeMap for consistent ordering

### Error Handling Improvements

- [ ] **Exit Code Standardization**: Fix non-standard exit codes
  - **Current:** `exit(-1)` becomes 255 (non-standard)
  - **Required:** Standard exit codes per requirements (0=success, 1=no rows, 2=config error)

---

## üèóÔ∏è Build and Package Standards (Low Priority)

### Cross-platform Distribution

- [ ] **Homebrew Formula**: Configure automated Homebrew tap updates
- [ ] **Package Formats**: Configure NFPM for deb/rpm packages

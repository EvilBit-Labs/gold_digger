## [Unreleased]

### BREAKING CHANGES
- **TLS Migration**: Removed `vendored` feature flag (OpenSSL dependency eliminated)
  - **Before**: `cargo build --features vendored` for static OpenSSL linking
  - **After**: Use `ssl` (native TLS) or `ssl-rustls` (pure Rust TLS) features
  - **Migration**: Remove `vendored` from any build scripts or CI configurations

### Features
- **TLS Implementation**: Added platform-native TLS support (removed vendored OpenSSL dependency)
  - Default `ssl` feature now uses `mysql/native-tls` with platform TLS libraries
  - Windows: Uses SChannel (built-in)
  - macOS: Uses SecureTransport (built-in)
  - Linux: Uses system native TLS libraries (may link to system OpenSSL)
  - Added `ssl-rustls` feature for pure Rust TLS implementation that avoids any OpenSSL linkage across all platforms

### Documentation
- Added comprehensive TLS configuration guide (TLS.md)
- Updated README.md with TLS implementation details
- Updated WARP.md and AGENTS.md with new TLS architecture

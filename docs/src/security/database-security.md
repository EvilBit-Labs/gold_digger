# Database Security

Security considerations for database connections and credential handling.

## Credential Protection

> [!WARNING]
> Never log or expose database credentials in output or error messages.

Gold Digger automatically redacts sensitive information from logs and error output.

## Connection Security

### Use Strong Authentication

- Create dedicated database users with minimal required permissions
- Use strong, unique passwords
- Consider certificate-based authentication where supported

### Network Security

- Always use TLS/SSL for remote connections
- Restrict database access by IP address when possible
- Use VPN or private networks for sensitive data

## Best Practices

1. **Principle of Least Privilege**: Grant only necessary permissions
2. **Regular Credential Rotation**: Update passwords regularly
3. **Monitor Access**: Log and review database access patterns
4. **Secure Storage**: Never store credentials in plain text files

# Security Best Practices

Comprehensive security guidelines for using Gold Digger in production.

## Production Deployment

### File Permissions

- Set restrictive permissions on output files containing sensitive data
- Use umask to control default file permissions
- Consider encrypting output files for highly sensitive data

### Credential Management

- Use environment variables instead of CLI flags for credentials
- Implement credential rotation procedures
- Use secrets management systems in containerized environments

### Network Security

- Always use TLS/SSL for database connections
- Restrict database access by IP address
- Use private networks or VPNs for sensitive operations

## Data Handling

### Output Security

- Review output files for sensitive information before sharing
- Implement data retention policies
- Use secure file transfer methods

### Query Safety

- Validate SQL queries before execution
- Use parameterized queries when possible
- Avoid exposing sensitive data in query logs

## Monitoring and Auditing

### Access Logging

- Log all database access attempts
- Monitor for unusual query patterns
- Implement alerting for security events

### Regular Security Reviews

- Audit database permissions regularly
- Review and update security configurations
- Test backup and recovery procedures
